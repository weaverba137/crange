* Allow additional sections of the ini file to specify additional

  switches or other configuration may be interpreted as additional
  entries for the absorber table.
* The pair production and bremsstrahlung computations should be updated
  to reflect SÃ¸rensen's 2010 paper (see art_ahs1 in the crange.bib file).
* Update instructions for creating a distribution file from GitHub;
  Update install from distribution instructions.
