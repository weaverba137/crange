Documentation
-------------

The main documentation for this package is processed by `Doxygen`_.  It is
available in HTML form.  It will be installed in

TODO
----

* Allow additional sections of the ini file to specify additional
  parameters such as the size of the range table and the minimum
  and maximum energy.  Sections of the ini file that do not define
  switches or other configuration may be interpreted as additional
  entries for the absorber table.
* The pair production and bremsstrahlung computations should be updated
  to reflect SÃ¸rensen's 2010 paper (see art_ahs1 in the crange.bib file).
