Tasks:

The first line tells the calculator to compute the range (in g cm^-2) of
uranium (Z=92,A=238) at a kinetic energy of 1200 MeV per nucleon, in an
aluminum target.  The second line tells the calculator to compute the
initial kinetic energy (in A MeV) of gold (Z=79,A=197) whose range in
the plastic track-etch detector CR-39 was 9.2 g cm^-2.  The third line asks
for the final kinetic energy after passing through 9.2 g cm^-2 of CR-39, given
an initial energy of 10.6 A GeV. The fourth line tells the calculator to
compute dE/dx (in A MeV g^-1 cm^2) for gold with kinetic energy 10.6 A GeV in
air.  The fifth line computes REL instead of dE/dx with the REL cutoff set to
300 eV. The sixth line computes primary ionization.
Arguments which are zero (0) are dummies which are necessary for
place-holding.

The list of tasks may be of any length in any combination of ranges,
energies, or dE/dx.  The order of the output will be the same as the
order of the input.
