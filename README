Thank you for choosing the Berkeley Range-Energy Calculator.

System requirements:

Although the range energy code has been verified only for SunOS and Linux,
it should run on any system with a C compiler.

Version:

This is version 1.6 of the Berkeley Range-Energy Calculator.

1.6:   Make crange compatible with GNU autotools & GNU Scientific Library.
1.5.3: Simplified calculation switching and added a crange.h file
1.5.2: Increased value of MAXAB to acommodate a larger target data file
1.5.1: Fixed typo in one of the parameters of the electron capture corection

Installation:

See the INSTALL file.

Running:

Some details can be found in the comments to crange.c.
The program is run by typing "crange [options] [data.in]".  The first
argument is the name of a file containing a list of tasks for the
calculator to perform.  There are a number of command-line options that
control the behaviour of crange.  These can be seen by typing crange -h

Tasks:

The input file is a list of tasks for the program to perform.  Here's
an example:

r 1200 0 92 238 Al
e 0 9.2 79 197 CR-39
e 10600 9.2 79 197 CR-39
d 10600 0 79 197 Air
d 10600 300 79 197 Air
j 10600 0 79 197 Air

The first line tells the calculator to compute the range (in g cm^-2) of
uranium (Z=92,A=238) at a kinetic energy of 1200 MeV per nucleon, in an
aluminum target.  The second line tells the calculator to compute the
initial kinetic energy (in A MeV) of gold (Z=79,A=197) whose range in
the plastic track-etch detector CR-39 was 9.2 g cm^-2.  The third line asks
for the final kinetic energy after passing through 9.2 g cm^-2 of CR-39, given
an initial energy of 10.6 A GeV. The fourth line tells the calculator to
compute dE/dx (in A MeV g^-1 cm^2) for gold with kinetic energy 10.6 A GeV in
air.  The fifth line computes REL instead of dE/dx with the REL cutoff set to
300 eV. The sixth line computes primary ionization.
Arguments which are zero (0) are dummies which are necessary for
place-holding.

The switch.ini file included with this distribution provides an example
for the user.  The values in the example file are those that are compiled
into the program by default.  Users may supply their own switch.ini file
on the command line. In order to do this, crange must be compiled against
the iniparser library, version 3.0 or later, see http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/.
If you don't wish to install this library, the code will still compile, but
you will not be able to change the default settings.

The list of tasks may be of any length in any combination of ranges,
energies, or dE/dx.  The order of the output will be the same as the
order of the input.  The available target materials are listed in the
target.ini file.  Target Data is taken from and is in the same order
as Sternheimer, Berger, & Seltzer, Atom. Data and Nucl. Data Tables
30 (1984) 261.  The definitions of the material properties are in the
target.ini file.  Note that the values in the target.ini file are already
compiled in to the program.  The user may add additional target materials or
override existing materials by creating a new target.ini file with new
or updated values.

More detailed explanations of each of these effects may be found in the
code itself, including references to the original literature.
