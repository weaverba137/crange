Thank you for choosing the Berkeley Range-Energy Calculator.

System requirements:

Although the range energy code has been verified only for SunOS and Linux, 
it should run on any system with a C compiler.

Version:

This is version 1.5.3 of the Berkeley Range-Energy Calculator.

1.5.3: Simplified calculation switching and added a crange.h file
1.5.2: Increased value of MAXAB to acommodate a larger target data file
1.5.1: Fixed typo in one of the parameters of the electron capture corection

Installation:

The directions for installation can be found in the Makefile.  Don't forget
to change the preprocessor definition DEDX (in the file crange.h) to the
correct path to the working directory for your installation.

Files:

dedx.tar.gz all files below as a GZIPed TAR archive
README      this file
Makefile    makefile for installation and compilation of code
target.dat  target data file
complex.c   file containing functions to implement complex number mathematics
complex.h   header file for complex number mathematics
crange.c    main range-energy code
crange.h    header file containing various defines for crange.c
switch.dat  file containing switches for different effects
COPYRIGHT   contains copyright information
LGPL        contains GNU Public License information

Running:

Some details can be found in the comments to crange.c and complex.c.
The program is run by typing "crange [data.in] [data.out]".  The first
arguement is the name of a file containing a list of tasks for the 
calculator to perform.  The second, optional arguement is the name of a
file to which the program will write its results.  If the second arguement
is not given, output will be written the standard output (stdout).

Tasks:

The input file is a list of tasks for the program to perform.  Here's
an example:

r 1200 0 92 238 Al
e 0 9.2 79 197 CR-39
e 10600 9.2 79 197 CR-39
d 10600 0 79 197 Air
d 10600 300 79 197 Air

The first line tells the calculator to compute the range (in g cm^-2) of 
uranium (Z=92,A=238) at a kinetic energy of 1200 MeV per nucleon, in an
aluminum target.  The second line tells the calculator to compute the
initial kinetic energy (in A MeV) of gold (Z=79,A=197) whose range in
the plastic track-etch detector CR-39 was 9.2 g cm^-2.  The third line asks
for the final kinetic energy after passing through 9.2 g cm^-2 of CR-39, given
an initial energy of 10.6 A GeV. The fourth line tells the calculator to 
compute dE/dx (in A MeV g^-1 cm^2) for gold with kinetic energy 10.6 A GeV in 
air.  The fifth line computes REL instead of dE/dx with the REL cutoff set to
300 eV. Arguments which are zero (0) are dummies which are necessary for
place-holding.

The list of tasks may be of any length in any combination of ranges,
energies, or dE/dx.  The order of the output will be the same as the 
order of the input.  The available target materials are listed in the
target.dat file.  Target Data is taken from and is in the same order
as Sternheimer, Berger, & Seltzer, Atom. Data and Nucl. Data Tables
30 (1984) 261.  The columns in target.dat are respectively: name,
charge, atomic mass, mean ionization potential, density, plasma frequency,
the five density effect parameters (X0, X1, a, m, d0), eta (gas
density ratio), and the absolute value of the total electronic binding
energy in keV.

The switch.dat file is now text-based for greater clarity to the user.

[sample]
Barkas=No
Shell=No
Leung=No
New Delta=Yes
New Electron Capture=No
FNS=Yes
Kinematic=No
Radiative=No
Pair=No
Bremsstrahlung=No

The effects should remain in this order, and the names of the effects on the
left-hand-side should remain the same.  The right-hand-side is case and 
length insensitive, so "y" or "n" should work as well as "Yes" or "No"

More detailed explanations of each of these effects may be found in the 
code itself, including references to the original literature.
