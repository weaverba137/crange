Energy vector might not be strictly necessary since one could in
principle compute i given energy.

The range table could be dynamically allocated for each target, that is,
the target structure would contain a pointer to a range table. Each
range table is only valid for a particular combination of target &
projectile.

tenerg[j] = exp(ln10*(l10Emin + j*(l10Emax-l10Emin)/(N-1)))

tenerg[N-1] = exp(ln10*(l10Emin + (N-1)*(l10Emax-l10Emin)/(N-1)))

log(tenerg[j]) = ln10*(l10Emin + j*(l10Emax-l10Emin)/(N-1))

log(tenerg[j])/ln10 -l10Emin = j*(l10Emax-l10Emin)/(N-1)

j = (log(tenerg[j])/ln10 - l10Emin)*(N-1)/(l10Emax-l10Emin)

Allow additional sections of the ini file to specify additional
parameters such as the size of the range table and the minimum
and maximum energy.  Sections of the ini file that do not define
switches or other configuration may be interpreted as additional
entries for the absorber table.
